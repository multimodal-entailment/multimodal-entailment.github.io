## Welcome

New social technologies and widespread access to the internet have allowed for new forms of content creation, connectivity and information sharing. With vast unstructured data and limited labels, organizing and reconciling information from different sources and modalities with bounded supervision is one of the current challenges in machine learning. This tutorial focuses on models and approaches for recognizing multimodal entailment, and uses as case study two real-world multi-domain datasets which prompt for understanding the fine-grained visual and linguistic semantics.

## Venue

The _Recognizing Multimodal Entailment_ tutorial will be held virtually at _ACL-IJCNLP 2021: The Joint Conference of the 59th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 11th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing_ on Sunday, August 1th, 2021.
